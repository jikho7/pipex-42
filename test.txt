[2] Use perror("Error") to debug, especially right after fork() or execve(), to see what is going on in the pipe.
Inside the pipe, everything done goes to one of its ends. printf for ex. wont print to the terminal or it will
print to your outfile (because we swapped the stdout); perror("Error") will work because it prints to stderr.
